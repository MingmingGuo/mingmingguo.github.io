<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome!

I'm currently a Ph.D. student majoring in Energy and Mechanical Engineering under the advisor of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dd9AE8sAAAAJ">Prof. Laurent Chaput</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6TEjRUwAAAAJ">Fabien Pascale</a> at University of Lorraine,<a href="https://lemta.univ-lorraine.fr/">CNRS-LEMTA</a>.



My research interest includes high-throughput computational screening approaches and machine learning to accelerate the materials discovery. And I will pursue the combination of theory and experiment to solve scientific problems. I have published more than 7 papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zvkzYukAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FMingmingGuo%2Fmingmingguo.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

[Theoretical investigation of HER/OER/ORR catalytic activity of single atom-decorated graphyne by DFT and comparative DOS analyses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169433222007966)

**Mingming Guo**, , MingJuan Ji, Wei Cui

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=zvkzYukAAAAJ&citation_for_view=zvkzYukAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='zvkzYukAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC'></span></strong>
- Our screening process showed that Co@GY and Ni@3B-GY would be highly promising multifunctional electrocatalysts for HER/OER/ORR. Then, we built quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) between electronic density of states (DOS) structure and catalytic performance using comparative DOS analysis (CoDOSA). The present results further support the development and application of d-band center theory. Our work identifies promising co-decorated GY for HER/OER/ORR and provides quantitative information on their DOS.
